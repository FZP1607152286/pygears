In this paper, we propose a hardware design methodology called Gears that builds on top of the RTL and focuses on hardware module composability, hence improving design reuse, scalability and testability. Gears introduces powerful data type system and enforces rules upon hardware modules' interfaces in order to utilize powerful concepts from the Category Theory.

Category theory is all about (provides the tools for) building complex systems by composition, and poor composability of the modules produced by current methodologies is exactly the major issue in hardware design .
