PyGears framework
=================

PyGears is an ambitious attempt to create a Python framework that facilitates describing digital hardware. It aims to augment current RTL methodology to drastically increase composability of hardware modules. Ease of composition leads to better reusability, since modules that compose better can be used in a wider variety of contexts. Set of reusable components can then form a well-tested and documented library that significantly speeds up the development process.

Furthermore, PyGears offers a way to write verification environment in high-level Python language and co-simulate the generated RTL with an external HDL simulator. PyGears features a completely free solution using Verilator simulator and standard SystemVerilog simulators via the DPI (tested on proprietary Questa and NCSim simulators).
