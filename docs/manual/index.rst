Getting Help
------------
The **PyGears** documentation gives you access to all the documentation that comes with **PyGears**. You can get more documentation, tutorials and community support online at https://www.pygears.org/.

If you're new to **PyGears**, you should start by reading :ref:`PyGears get started <get_started>` , which is a general intro for beginners and provides some background to help you navigate the rest of **PyGears**' extensive documentation.

For ease of access, the **PyGears** manual has been split up into several sections.

Description
-----------
**PyGears** is a open-sourced framework that lets you design hardware using high-level Python constructs and compile it to synthesizable SystemVerilog or Verilog code. There is a built-in simulator that lets you use arbitrary Python code with its vast set of libraries to verify your hardware modules. **PyGears** makes connecting modules easy, and has built-in synchronization mechanisms that help you build correct parallel systems.
